I used a linear regression model with 5 features to describe the user reviews of a book on GoodReads.com

The first round of testing yieled an R2 value of .23. More data is required and the features will need major adjustments before finalizing. 

It should be noted that I adjusted my projet from the original proposal because my original project had too much multicollinearity in its features. The overall score of the coffee reviews were the added up value of the sub-categories I was looking to examine.
